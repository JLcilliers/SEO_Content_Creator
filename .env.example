# Scraping Configuration (Optimized for quality with background processing)
# Now that we use background workers, we can prioritize quality over speed
SCRAPE_MAX_PAGES=5
SCRAPE_CONCURRENCY=3
SCRAPE_TIMEOUT_MS=8000

# Performance Notes:
# - Background worker has 300s (5 minute) timeout
# - max_pages: 5-10 pages for comprehensive context
# - concurrency: 3 parallel requests for faster scraping
# - timeout_ms: 8000ms per page for reliable data extraction
#
# With background processing using Supabase:
# - No more timeout issues
# - Frontend gets immediate response with job ID
# - User sees real-time progress updates
# - Quality settings restored to optimal levels
# - Jobs stored in Supabase PostgreSQL database
