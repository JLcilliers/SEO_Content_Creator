# Scraping Configuration (Optimized for Vercel 60s timeout)
# These are aggressive defaults - increase if quality suffers
SCRAPE_MAX_PAGES=2
SCRAPE_CONCURRENCY=2
SCRAPE_TIMEOUT_MS=4000

# Performance Notes:
# - max_pages: 2-3 pages usually sufficient for context
# - concurrency: Keep low to avoid overwhelming target sites
# - timeout_ms: 4000-5000ms per page is aggressive but necessary
#
# Total scraping time estimate: 4-16 seconds (2 pages × 4-8s each)
# Claude generation time: 15-35 seconds
# Total execution: 20-50 seconds (safely under 60s limit)
